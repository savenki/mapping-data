The wine is all succulent, ripe citrus with toasty tangerine, orange zest and lemon-lime. Toasty gun-barrel oak and vanilla, together with tropical fruit skin and spice completes the package. Buttressed by a framework of native acidity the wine is gauzy in weight and texture, staying up in the palate before finishing with focus and clarity.","723":"The nose alone takes our 2017 Barcaglia Lane Chardonnay to the highest level, with nectarine and vanilla chiffon, sterling rose and preserved lemon, mineral, and sweet oak spice. Deftly weighted with citrus and tree fruits the wine achieves balance through a ribbon of native acidity carrying on to a lengthy succulent finish.","726":"Showcasing the unique personalities of small hillside vineyards from Pritchard Hill, Rutherford, and Calistoga our 2005 Napa Valley Cabernet delivers complex aromas of black currant, sweet oak spice, espresso and tobacco. 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine makes a sweeping broad entry with briary, black fruit at the core and compelling chocolate flavors that yield to a long chewy finish.","731":"Dense, layered aromas with sweet cocoa, alluring oak spice and wow-factor frontal fruit, the wine is showy yet seriously structured. Creamy melted berry character gives way to supple muscle with integrated tannins and a long, lavish finish.","737":"The relatively cool 2006 harvest enhanced the inherent Rhone character of our Hudson Vineyards Syrah from these famously farmed vines in Napa Carneros. Finely woven and complex this 100% Syrah from a single small block serves up a potpourri of red\/black fruits, white pepper, herbes de Provence, and allspice. Black raspberry fruit flavors are framed in toasty oak and brought to fine focus. ","739":"Mason has been going to CrossFit and it shows. No whiskers yet but his 2015 vintage has more serious character, complexity and muscle than ever. Redolent with deeply ripened berries, baker's chocolate, cola, and cedary oak spice the wine is concentrated and rich on entry. Picking up notes of caf\u00e9 latte toward the finish, a network of sinewy yet supple tannins provides a platform for this bulked up wine. ","740":"Sporting some Senior-year swagger, the 2018 Mason\u2019s Cabernet is front-loaded with black plum, cherry, chocolate and cedary spice.  Sourced from several of the same vineyards as our Napa Cabernet this wine is boldly fruited yet youthful with tons of juicy character and a deliciously fresh finish.","741":"Bursting with black plum and sweet cedar our Merlot is opulent and delicious, rivaling any of our Merlot bottlings to date. These low-yielding vines from Oakville, Oak Knoll and Pritchard Hill have produced a wine that is smooth, yet thickly textured, jammy yet serious.","742":"Crafted from a combination of Oak Knoll vines and longer-hanging Carneros clusters, our 2008 Napa Valley Chardonnay is satisfyingly ripe, yet focused and fresh in the same sip. Showy stone fruit, pear, hazelnut and toasty oak spices spill from the glass. Rich-bodied, fruitful and round on the palate with vanilla and subtle minerality, the wine is threaded with lively acidity bringing length and focus to a fine finish.","743":"Grapes for the 2015 Napa Chardonnay came in early and the wine centers around ripe Bosc pear and Fuji apple with delicious caramel custard, pie crust and hazelnut. Thickly textured and satiny smooth like Deux-Sevres butter, the richness and weight are buttressed with native acidity and subtle minerality bringing complexity and length to this delicious wine.","745":"Golden delicious apple, honeysuckle blossom and toasty caramel spice aromas are served up generously in the 2016 Napa Chardonnay. Silky in texture with ripe tree fruit and plenty of drive the wine is athletic and complex with a tail of smoky mineral and lees character.","751":"The nose is powerful with cedar, oak and blackberry aromas. The palate is muscular, densely layered with black fruit and dark chocolate flavors, integrated with full round tannins. Delicious now, this wine will continue to improve with bottle age.","752":"Our 2000 Reserve Cabernet is a beautiful, showy wine, spilling-over with spicy oak and aromatic cedar, centered on opulent black fruit. Absolutely rich, ripe and round, we used 90% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cabernet Franc and 3% Merlot in this Reserve blend. A cloak of vanilla, clove and seductive oak spice wraps around a deeply fruited core of currant and wild berries with hints of anise and chocolate that gradually give way to long, mouth-coating tannins. 2,300 cases produced. ","765":"Neil Young's \"Cinnamon Girl\" best captures the character of our rocking 2015 Reserve Chardonnay. Ripe yet succulent D'Anjou pear, gardenia blossom, sweet mineral spice and toasty brioche aromas come singing through. Broad-shouldered, with creamy textured leesy flavors, the wine reaches great depth while maintaining precision and serious structure.","768":"When asked to describe our Reserve Merlot as briefly as possible our response is \"velvet hammer.\" Supple and velvety rich on the palate, layered with dark ripe fruit, the wine finishes polished and round.","769":"The warm, vibrant character and seductive imagery of Paul Gauguin's Tahiti are captured in our 2016 Sauvignon Blanc. Awash in ripe mango, guava and papaya and laced with tropical blossoms, vanilla and spice, the wine is lush and luxuriant, fruitful to the core, yet draped in native acidity and a fleck of salinity that frame and lengthen the canvas.","770":"Like a sailplane this 2018 Sauvignon Blanc soars with alluring floral spice, lemon-lime zest and hints of vanilla. A leading edge of native acidity frames a camber line of ripe mango and tropical fruit that tails gracefully with succulent lime skin and subtle mineral.","772":"Blazing tropical fruit, exotic spices and sexy ripe citrus come together in this tangerine dream. Like a beach volleyball Olympian, the wine has explosive power plus tremendous depth and range on the palate. Richness and precision are continually on point, and the wine sets up high in the mouth before stretching out in a tanned and impossibly long-legged, leesy finish. ","773":"Chardonnay is whole cluster pressed, barrel fermented and aged sur lies with batonnage in 100% French oak for 11-15 months, undergoing 100% malolactic fermentation, then bottled unfined and unfiltered. ","774":"Our Sonoma Chardonnay comes from some of the oldest Dutton Ranch plantings in Russian River. These vines consistently yield fruit of great complexity and intensity seldom found in other sites. Cooler temperatures toward the end of the 2008 growing season resulted in crisp, well-defined flavors and long ripening times. Ripe citrus, Tupelo honey and sweet floral notes combined with seductive oak and all-spice aromas are just the beginning. Sun-ripened citrus fruit flavors are framed with brilliant acidity giving this wine its trademark zest and tremendous length.","775":"Now 7 years old, Alec's younger brother Ethan shows sunny pride in his new Ethan's Syrah, Lewis' first bottling since the 2001 vintage. And like the sunflowers and lavender in France this wine displays true Rhone character. From cooler-climate vines this 100% Syrah blend is infused with smoky fruit, white pepper and wild floral notes. Sweet shadings of violet and bacon frame a pure focused palate, gathering weight and richness in a plush and persistent finish.","778":"Blend: 99% Cabernet Sauvignon, 1% Merlot ","779":"Blend: 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot"}}
